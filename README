Installation:

Place the plugin in your Rhythmbox plugin folder.
If it doesn't exist then simply create one. Usually
it resides here:

~/.local/share/rhythmbox/plugins/

Sometimes here...
~/.gnome2/rhythmbox/plugins

Then activate it and press the new Full Screen button
apearing at Rhythmbox's top menu.

## fork

this is a fork from this repository:
 - http://code.google.com/p/rhythmbox-fullscreen-plugin/source/list

The intention is to correct the current issues that prevent a global installation & thus prevents a debian package from being created.
